# Insecure Acebook



## Getting started

This project has been adapted from the [Acebook Flask Template](https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-flask-template). It has been modified to make it more insecure now!

Some of the challenges may need you to experiment with the app running locally on your machine. Please refer to the repository linked above for instructions on how to set up the project.

## Our GitLab Pipeline

You will have to rename the `.example-gitlab-ci.yml` file in order for the pipeline to be triggered, as you have seen in previous weeks.
