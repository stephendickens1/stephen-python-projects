# For: greeter.py

# We create a method using `def`, parameters in brackets
def greet(name):  # <--  Don't forget the colon!
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Note the `f` before the string here enables string
    # interpolation. Try removing it and see.


# Looking for the end?
# That's the great thing about Python: there's no end!

# Now we call the method like so:
greet("World")
